# Wallet Game: Resource Combo Engine
2-3 players.

## Challenge:
18 cards Wallet Game

## Rules
Following is the setup, play, and game end for this Wallet game

### Setup
Flip all cards to their tan side and align the edge dots so all cards are in the same rotation.
Shuffle the cards thoroughly without rotating the cards.
Deal 2 cards to each player.
Take the top half of the deck and flip it over to the teal side.
Shuffle the two halves back together.

Place the shuffled deck on the table and move the top three cards into the market.
Do not flip or rotate the cards during this.

Then each player will take their received cards, flip them so they have one teal and one tan side.
Then they rotate their cards so that the edge without dots is facing them.

Lastly, determine a starting player by whichever means the group prefer.

### Playing the game

#### Important Concepts

* Market: The market is the 3 available cards next to the draw pile. If after an action there are less than 3 cards in the market, move cards from the draw deck unto the market until there again are 3 cards in the market.

* Discard: A pile of used cards next to the draw pile. If the draw pile is ever empty, shuffle the discard pile to become the new draw deck.

* Orientation: Each cards have an orientation. When a card is moved it must maintain its current orientation. Cards in a players zone is oriented relative to the player and cards on the market or in the draw and discard piles are oriented relative to the draw pile. If a card moves from a player zone to the deck zone, or vice versa, the card is rotated so that the orientation stays the same relative to the new zone.

* Replace: If a card is replaced with another card, the new card will have the same orientation (amount of dots facing the player or the deck) as the replaced card.

* Resources: Cards in front of a player indicates the players resources. The amount of resources are indicated by the dots closest to the player, and the type of resource is indicated by the colour of the dots. There are two types of resource in the game. A player can at most have 3 of each resource -- any excess are lost.

* Swapping: When asked to swap two cards in the deck zone, the cards maintain their individual orientation. When swapping a card between a player zone and the deck zone, then the colours much be identical, but the cards will trade orientation as well as spatial position -- This allows swapping without breaking the game state completely.

#### Player Turn
On a player's turn they may perform all of the following actions once in any order.

* Activate *or* buy a card from the market.

* Activate a card in that player's zone.

* Flip *or* rotate a card in the market.

Any card action may allow a player to perform multiple of the same action during a turn, but this is an exception to the rule.

Once a player decides to not perform any more actions, or have no actions left to perform, play passes to the next player.

Play continues until one player has bought enough cards from the market.

##### Activate a card
A player may activate the bottom most effect of any card in the market or in front of themselves.
The bottom most effect in the market is the one furthest from the draw pile.
Only the effect in the coloured box can be played -- the other is just an indication of the effect on the reverse side.

On a given turn the player may activate one card from the market and one card from in front of themselves.
In order to activate a card from in front of themselves, the player must have an amount of resources from that card to have an ability face them.
If no ability is facing the player (e.g; the card is facing the player on the short edge), then the player cannot use an ability from that card.

When activating a card, a player moves that card to the discard pile (without changing its relative orientation).
Then the player follows the effect of the card, and lastly the player will receive 1 energy of that cards type.

When a player moves a card from in front of them to the discard pile, this card is immediately replaced with the top card of the draw deck.

Note: Some effects will ask the player to take their energy from the discarded card immediately instead of after the resulting action.
This is the mostly the case when waiting to claim that energy would cause a lot of book keeping -- e.g. several chained activations.

##### Buy a card
A player may buy a single card should they have the resources for it.
When buying a card, the player declares their intention to buy it and pay the required resources from the cards in front of them.
Resources are indicated by the dots on the cards in the player's zone closest to the player.
A player pays resources by rotating the cards in their zone so the dots closest to them are indicating their new resource balance.
In order to buy a card, a player must pay the amount and types of resources indicated by the large central bars on the card.

##### Flip a card
A player may flip a single card from the market by flipping it to its reverse side, maintaining its respective orientation.
Players may not flip cards in front of them.

##### Rotate a card
A player may rotate a single card from the market by rotating it 180 degrees.
The orientation relative to the draw pile must now be exactly opposite of what it previously was.
Players may not rotate cards in front of them.


### Game end
The game will end the moment a single player has bought enough cards from the market.
For 3 players, the first player to 3 bought cards wins.
For 2 players, the first player to 4 bought cards wins.
